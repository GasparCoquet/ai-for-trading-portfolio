# AI for Trading Portfolio

This repository showcases projects inspired by the **Udacity AI for Trading Nanodegree**, focusing on practical applications of **quantitative finance**, **algorithmic trading**, **portfolio optimization**, and **natural language processing**. These projects demonstrate the use of advanced data analysis techniques, machine learning algorithms, and backtesting frameworks in the context of modern financial markets.

## Projects Included

### 1. Basic Quantitative Trading
- **Trading with Momentum**  
  Implement a momentum-based trading strategy using historical stock prices. Compute signals, evaluate statistical significance, and test for profitability.

### 2. Advanced Quantitative Trading
- **Breakout Strategy**  
  Develop and evaluate a breakout strategy by identifying and filtering outliers, testing for alpha, and optimizing the model for trading signals.

### 3. Stocks, Indices & ETFs
- **Smart Beta Portfolio Optimization**  
  Build a smart beta portfolio by analyzing fundamental data, calculating tracking errors, and optimizing portfolio weights using quadratic programming.

### 4. Factor Investing & Alpha Research
- **Multi-Factor Model**  
  Research and generate alpha factors, evaluate their performance, and construct a portfolio using advanced optimization techniques, including risk models and factor constraints.

### 5. Sentiment Analysis with Natural Language Processing
- **Sentiment Analysis Using NLP**  
  Analyze corporate filings (e.g., 10-Q and 10-K statements) using Natural Language Processing. Use bag-of-words and TF-IDF models to generate sentiment-based trading signals.

### 6. Advanced Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning
- **Sentiment Analysis with Neural Networks**  
  Build sentiment analysis models using deep learning techniques like LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory networks). Train models on financial news to predict market sentiment.

### 7. Combining Multiple Signals
- **Combining Signals for Enhanced Alpha**  
  Combine various trading signals using random forest models. Handle overlapping data samples and refine signal selection through feature engineering.

### 8. Backtesting and Portfolio Analysis
- **Simulating Trades with Historical Data**  
  Build a realistic backtesting system that includes transaction costs, portfolio optimization, and performance attribution to analyze profit-and-loss drivers.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Quantitative Finance and Trading
